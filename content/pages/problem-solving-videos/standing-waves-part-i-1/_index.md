## About this Video

{{< resource uuid="b9f347cf-831e-d4ed-5bdb-a8a54c019bd3" >}}

 

Continuation of the discussion of systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom, in particular where the oscillators are identical, harmonic, and connected only to their neighbors. In this session, we discuss a situation where the solution of the wave equation can best be described in terms of the superposition of normal modes (a mathematical technique known as *Fourier analysis*).
