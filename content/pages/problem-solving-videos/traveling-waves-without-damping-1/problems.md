## Traveling Waves without Damping

### {{< anchor "problem1" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Problem 1

There is a horizontal taut ideal string with a length of 8 meters, fixed at the left end (\\(x=0\\)) and attached to a massless ring free to slide on a frictionless rod on the right end at \\(x=8\\ m\\). The string has a mass of 0.5 kilograms and tension of 4 Newtons, assumed to be constant.

At \\(t=0\\) the profiles of the transverse displacement \\(y\\) and transverse velocity, \\( \\dfrac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} \\), of the string are as shown below.

On the graph below, sketch the shape of the string at \\(t = 0.25\\) sec, and at \\(t = 1\\) sec. Make sure you indicate the scale for \\(y\\).

This type of problem is done most easily by decomposing waveforms into superposition of progressive waves.

### {{< anchor "problem2" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Problem 2

Voltage, current waves propagating on a transmission line undergo reflection and transmission at a junction between lines with different characteristics. If one considers two transmission lines, joined at \\(x=0\\), with inductance and capacitance (per unit length) of \\(L\\) and \\(C\\) for \\(x \< 0\\), and \\(L\\) and \\(C/4\\) for \\(x > 0\\), then the characteristic phase velocity and impedance increase by a factor of 2 across the junction at \\(x=0\\). Show that this results in transmission and reflected voltage amplitudes (relative to the incoming pulse) of

\\begin{eqnarray} \\nonumber T &=& \\frac{4}{3} \\\\ \\nonumber R &=& \\frac{1}{3} \\end{eqnarray}

Also show that, in spite of the increased amplitude of transmission and the existence of a reflected pulse, energy is conserved in this system.

Show that the sum of the power flowing in the transmitted and reflected pulses adds up, exactly, to the incident power.
