  "course_description": "[_8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves_](/courses/8-03sc-physics-iii-vibrations-and-waves-fall-2016/) is the third course in the core physics curriculum at MIT, following _8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics_ and _8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism_. Topics include mechanical vibrations and waves, electromagnetic waves, and optics. These Problem Solving Help Videos provide step-by-step solutions to sample problems. Also included is information about how Physics III is typically taught on the MIT campus. [Instructor Insights](/resources/res-8-005-vibrations-and-waves-problem-solving-fall-2012/instructor-insights/) are shared by Professor Wit Busza who has taught Physics III and its associated recitation sessions many times. Professor Busza's insights focus on his approach to problem solving, strategies for supporting students as they solve problems, and common sources of confusion for students in the process of problem solving.\n\n**Note**: These videos were originally produced as part of a physics course that is no longer available on OCW.\n",
