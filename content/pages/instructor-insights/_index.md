## Course Overview

The Problem Solving Help Videos provided in this supplemental resource offer step-by-step solutions to sample problems typically encountered in _8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves,_ an undergraduate-level course in which students learn about harmonic motion, superposition, forced vibrations and resonance, coupled oscillations, normal modes, and other topics.

The Instructor Insights on this page are shared by Professor Wit Busza, who has taught _Physics III_ and its associated recitation sessions many times. At MIT, recitations are opportunities for students to work through problems related to lecture content. Professor Busza’s insights focus on his approach to problem solving, strategies for supporting students as they solve problems, and common sources of confusion for students in the process of problem solving.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Understand that almost all natural phenomena involve waves and vibrations
- Learn equations that, although identical, can be used to describe very different phenomena
- Be able to distinguish how the physics differs in each of these cases
- Apply understanding of laws of nature in problem solving

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

_8.03 Physics III_ is the third course in a sequence of four physics courses. It prepares students to take [_8.04 Quantum Physics I_](/courses/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2013).
